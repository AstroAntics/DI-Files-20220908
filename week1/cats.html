    <h1>About Cats</h1>
    <p>
      In contrast to lions or other big cats, domestic cats are more frequently
      called <em>house cats</em> as there is (generally) no reason to
      distinguish them from other cats. <br />
      Cats are often prized by humans for their intellect and companionship, and
      worldwide there are more than
      <span class="highlight">seventy</span> cat breeds!
    </p>
    <h1>Cat senses</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears.
      </li>
      <li>Cats can see in near-total or total darkness.</li>
      <li>Cats have worse color vision - but better smell - than humans do.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>The History of The Common Catâ„¢</h1>
    <p>
      Cats were venerated in Ancient Egypt, but there may have been instances of
      domestication as early as 7,500 BCE, or just around 9,500 years ago.
      That's pretty recent! Cats are a member of the <em>felid</em> family,
      which includes cat names like:
      <ul class="roman-numerals">
        <li>Lions</li>
        <li>Tigers</li>
        <li>Cougars</li>
      </ul>

    <h1 id="lions">Lions</h1>
    <p>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, 
      but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts 
      to being active at night and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. 
      Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. 
      Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffes.</p>
